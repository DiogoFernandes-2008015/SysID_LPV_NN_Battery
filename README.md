# SysID_LPV_NN_Battery
This repository aims to propose a Linear Varying Parameter (LPV) model for an Equivalent Circuit Model (ECM) of a battery.

According to ____, for a better fit between the ECM and experimental data, the resistors and capacitors of the circuit must change as the state of charge and temperature change. Therefore, as SOC is one of the states of the model, a neural network can be trained in such a manner that its output will represent the parameter as a function of the state of charge.
